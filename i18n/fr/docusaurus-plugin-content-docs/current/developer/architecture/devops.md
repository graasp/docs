### Infrastructure as code (IaC)

:::caution Coming soon !

Current infrastructure wsa built by hand using a combination of AWS Console UI and AWS CLI.
The transition to a fully managed infrastructure as code is in progress.
This will allow us to migrate to different data-centers and keep track of changes made to the infra.

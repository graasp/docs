# How to Offload a Process to a Worker

To offload a process to a background worker, follow these steps. Start by identifying the category your process belongs to. If a queue for that category already exists, reuse it. Otherwise, create a new queue and its associated worker.

## üîß Creating a New Queue and Worker

1. **Name Your Queue and Job**

   - Choose a descriptive and unique name for your queue. Keep in mind it might handle similar jobs.
   - Define a descriptive and unique name for the job that represents your process.

2. **Add the Job to the Queue**

   - In your controller, instantiate the queue and add the job using the names defined above.

3. **Register the Queue in the Dashboard**

   - In `dashboard.controller.ts`, register your new queue so it appears in the monitoring dashboard.

4. **Create a Worker Class**
   - Create a new class that encapsulates a `BullMQ`'s `Worker`.
   - Ensure the worker **starts immediately** when the class is instantiated, and is configured to listen only to the specific job name defined earlier.
   - The worker should contain the logic to handle the job and any error handling or logging as needed.
   - Instantiate the worker class in `workers/entrypoint.ts`.

## üîÅ Reusing an Existing Queue

1. **Define the Job Name**

   - Choose a clear and unique job name that accurately describes the new job.

2. **Add the Job to the Queue**

   - In your controller, reuse the existing queue and add your new job.

3. **Update the Worker**
   - Modify the existing worker class for that queue so it can handle your new job.

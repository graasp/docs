## Make sure you have installed dependencies

Run `yarn` at the root of the project (same level as the package.json file). You should see a `node_modules` folder get generated.

## CORS error with app

Apps need to be registered with a corresponding publisher. Publisher decides which origins are allowed.

:::danger
The CORS check is done at startup, so if changes are made on the DB, they will take effect only at the next restart.

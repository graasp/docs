# Tags

Tags are simple words or phrases added to content (like articles, videos, or blog posts) to describe its main topics or themes. For example, a course about climate change might have tags like _"climate"_ _"greenhouse effect"_ or _"ecology"_ These tags make it easier to find content related to those topics when you search.

When content is tagged with clear, specific terms, it's easier for both users and search engines to find it. By manually entering tags that closely match the words people are likely to search for, you improve the chances that your content will appear in search results.

## Tag Categories available on Graasp Library

For a finer categorization of tags and search filter, Graasp provides different categories you can add tags to:

- **Discipline**: Set of tags based on specific areas of study or educational fields. It helps classify resources according to academic subjects like _"mathematics"_, _"history"_ or _"biology"_.
- **Level**: Set of tags to classify educational content according to the learner’s stage or proficiency, like _"elementary"_, _"high school"_ or _"undergraduate"_.
- **Resource Type**: Set of tags to categorize content based on the format or medium in which it is delivered, like _"article"_, _"video"_, _"lecture"_, _"quiz"_ or _"eBook"_.

## Best Practices for Manual Tagging

To get the most out of your tags, here are a few simple tips:

- **Be Specific**: The more specific the tag, the easier it is for someone to find exactly what they’re looking for. For example, instead of just tagging a resource with _"physics"_ tag it with more specific terms like _"centrifugal force"_.

- **Use Consistent Tags**: Stick to a consistent set of tags across your content. This helps keep everything organized and makes it easier for both users and search engines to find related content.

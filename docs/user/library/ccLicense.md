# Creative Commons Licensing

A Creative Commons (CC) license is a type of public copyright license that allows creators to grant permission for others to use, share, and sometimes modify their work, under specific conditions. In the context of educational resources, CC licenses are especially important because they promote open access to knowledge and materials. By using CC-licensed resources, educators and students can freely access high-quality content without legal or financial barriers, fostering collaboration, innovation, and equitable learning opportunities worldwide. These licenses support the creation and sharing of Open Educational Resources (OER), helping to reduce costs, improve learning outcomes, and ensure that education is more inclusive and accessible for all.

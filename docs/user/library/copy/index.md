# Why copying a capsule?

Copying a capsule in your space allows you to reuse existing content without altering the original, making it easy to build on proven ideas or customize the content to fit your specific needs or audience. Additionally, copying gives you the flexibility to use it privately, so you can experiment, test changes, or refine the content in your own workspace without affecting the public version.

:::warning
Before copying and reusing a capsule, it’s important to check the Creative Commons (CC) license associated with it. Some capsules may come with restrictions, ignoring these terms can lead to copyright issues or misuse of someone else’s work. Always review the license details and respect the original creator’s permissions to ensure your use complies with the intended sharing guidelines.

# Sharing

Under the **Share** section, you can manage permission to your content.

## Access levels

For each item, each user is attributed an permission level: read, write or admin. You can find below what each access grants:

| Item                         | Read | Write | Admin |
| ---------------------------- | ---- | ----- | ----- |
| View                         | ✓    | ✓     | ✓     |
| Copy                         | ✓    | ✓     | ✓     |

Some permissions may be inherited from folders. A permission level can be more greater or equal lower the item is in the hierarchy.

## Item visibility

Each item has one of visibility level from the following:

- **Private** (default): Only members with permissions can access your item
- **Pseudonymized**: Access with a pseudonym, with or without password
- **Public**: Anyone can view the item

See below for more details.

### **Private**

This is the default visibility level. Admins have full control over who can access the item through the access control panel. Only users explicitly listed in this panel will be able to view or interact with the item.

People without authorization can request an access, that admins can accept in the access control panel.

### **Pseudonymized**

Pseudonymized visibility allows anyone with the link to access your item using a pseudonym.

This option is ideal for sharing content with users who don't have (or cannot create) a Graasp account (e.g., primary school pupils).

To enhance security:

- You can **enable password protection** to prevent unauthorized access (for example by name guessing).
- You can **freeze connections** to restrict access to only those who have already registered. This prevents new pseudonymized accounts from being created while still allowing existing ones to connect.

Graasp accounts can also access your item automatically.

### **Public**

Public visibility allows **anyone with the link** to access your item.  
**Caution:** Do not share sensitive or private data when using this mode.

Items published on the library are all public, and will be unpublished if you change the visibility.

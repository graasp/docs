# Account Validation

When you use the Graasp platform, a verified email address is required.

The email address verification is required to create content, publish content in the library and more. Once you have verified your email address you will be able to use all features of the platform.

## When you see the "Your account needs to be validated" message

If you see the message "Your account needs to be validated" (see the image bellow) it means we still need to validate that you have access to the **email address** you provided when you created your Graasp account.

## How to validate my account ? {#validate-account}

To validate your account you need to:

1. Check which email you use with your Graasp account.
2. Ensure you have access to this email.
   1. If you do not have access to this email anymore, [change your email](../account/email#change-email).
3. Use that email to [login via email](../login#login-email).
4. Your account will be validated when you use the link we send you by email.

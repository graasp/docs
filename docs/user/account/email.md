# Email address

On the Graasp platform, your email is used to log in (via magic link) and receive notifications (you can disable notifications in your profile).

## What email is used with my Graasp account ? {#email-used}

You can find which email is used with your current Graasp account by clicking your name in the top right corner of the page. The popup should display your name, avatar picture and email address like the image below.

If you do not see an email address, this means you are logged in with a pseudonymised (or guest) account. These account have limited abilities and can only access content from the element they were created on. Lag out og this account and log in with your full Graasp account if you have one. If you do not have a Graasp account yet, you can create one with just an email in a few minutes. See [create a Graasp account](../create-account) for more information.

## Backend: consequent upgrade with Drizzle

Over the past few weeks, the Graasp team has been working to make Graasp faster, more stable, and easier to maintain. We've completed a major upgrade to the _backend_ — the part of the platform that works behind the curtain to make everything run by moving our system to a new technology called **Drizzle.js** alongside an automated delivery process. While you don't need to know the technical details, think of it like upgrading the engine of a car — the outside might look the same, but it runs smoother and is easier to work on in the future. The change should be transparent to you!

#### Feedback is welcome!

Even though we’ve tested this upgrade thoroughly, real-world usage is the best test of all. If you notice **anything not working quite right** — like something behaving differently than expected, slowing down, or breaking — please let us know.

Your feedback helps us keep Graasp running smoothly for everyone.

<!-- Generic message -->

We warmly welcome and encourage feedback from our users to continuously improve our platform. You can contact us by email [admin@graasp.org](mailto:admin@graasp.org) or by submitting an issue in this [Github repository](https://github.com/graasp/graasp-feedback).

## Home Page & Navigation

With this update, we've redesigned the interface of your personal homepage for a more streamlined experience. It now displays, just like before, the items shared with you and your bookmarked content, but with enhanced accessibility. We hope this update makes it even easier to access the items you use most frequently!

Additionally, we've revamped the side menu of the Builder view. It now features the same navigation tree as in the Player, providing a clear view of your item's structure and a better understanding of the hierarchy of your content.

**Bullet list of the improvements:**

- Display accessible items and bookmarks directly on the home page for easy access.
- Transform the drawer content into tabs in the right-hand side corner of the home page for a clearer navigation.
- Include settings and tutorials within the member drop-down menu for easier access. Replace the “Profile” option with “Home” in the user menu popup for clearer options.
- Show item tree navigation in the builder to enhance the user experience when working with complex items.

Don't hesitate to share your feedback with us, so we can improve even more your experience with Graasp!

In addition, note those major new features:

- A new option allows reader to write within an etherpad document (you can find the option when creating or editing an etherpad).
- Links can have their URL changed.

## Bug Fixes & Updates

- Resolve app resizing issues.
- Prevent membership requests from being made for hidden items.

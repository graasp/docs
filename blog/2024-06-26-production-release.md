The Graasp team has been working on improving translations and fixing recurring issues to improve the overall user experience. Read further for more details!

## Account

- Fix an issue related to the avatar upload, where the image was artificially growing in size making it impossible to upload moderately sized pictures.

## Player

- We worked on performance improvements. The navigation tree on the left should now be faster to load on large courses. The navigation island (at the bottom of the page) should now also not allow navigating to hidden folders. Previously admins could see hidden folders, but this was not intended. This has now been fixed.

<!-- Generic message -->

We warmly welcome and encourage feedback from our users to continuously improve our platform. You can contact us by email [admin@graasp.org](mailto:admin@graasp.org) or by submitting an issue in this [Github repository](https://github.com/graasp/graasp-feedback).

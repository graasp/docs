## Builder

- The user interface for adding links has been updated and enhanced. There is now 3 ways you can display a link in Graasp:
  1. As a simple Hyperlink (blue underlined text), perfect for adding a discret reference
  2. As a fancy card, showing the website thumbnail and description
  3. When supported by the website you are adding, as an embedded iframe, allowing direct navigation from inside your learning unit. This option is also available when the lunk you are adding targets rich media like videos, who expose embedded media players.

## Backend

Below are the latest changes deployed on [Graasp Staging](https://builder.stage.graasp.org).

:::warning[Important notes]

- You might need to create a new account on [the staging environnement](https://auth.stage.graasp.org) since the staging environment uses a different database as production's.
- Use a different browser or an incognito session to prevent cookie collision.

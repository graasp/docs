## Builder

- **Publication Page Enhancement**: The publication page has undergone a comprehensive revamp, featuring extensive guidelines for setting useful metadata. Validation is now required whenever an item is updated. While the process still involves a validation followed by the publication â€” a future improvement will consolidate these steps into a single click.

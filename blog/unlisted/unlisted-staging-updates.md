## Graasp Analytics

![analytics member dashboard](./analytics-member-dashboard.png)

- **Member Statistic Page:** We developed a dashboard to display the member statistics across the entire Graasp ecosystem. This tool will allow users to track their activity and engagement over time with visual representations such as graphs and charts. By providing insights into usage patterns, the dashboard helps users understand their involvement and productivity within the platform. Additional graphics and interactive features will be added soon to enhance the user experience and provide even deeper insights.

## Graasp Builder

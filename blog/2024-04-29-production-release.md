- Users now have the ability to delete thumbnails associated with items.
- During the export process, only writers have the privilege to access hidden items.
- Now, when copying an item, its thumbnails are also copied.

## Graasp Player

- Users are now allowed to leave their display names empty if they choose to do so.

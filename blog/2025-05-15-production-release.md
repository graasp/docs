A backend refactor has been implemented, focused on file handling, app data files and app setting files, improving the overall architecture. These updates are reflected in the File Drop app, Excalidraw app, and the client frontend, enhancing the efficiency and stability across all components. The changes should be transparent, but let us know if you notice anything!

## Backend (details)

- Unified file handling for consistency: replace the value "s3File" from the item's type options with generic "file".
- Updated dependencies for improved security and performance

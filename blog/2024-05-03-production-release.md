- **Allow CC License Preview**: Enable users to preview different licensing options directly within the dialog before making a final selection, providing them with more information and flexibility in choosing the appropriate license for their content.
- **Improve Settings Page and Overall**: Conduct a comprehensive review of the settings page to streamline options, improve user interface elements, and enhance overall user experience, ensuring that users can easily access and manage their items' settings.

## Graasp Library

- **Add OER Info Page**: Introduce a dedicated <a href="https://library.graasp.org/oer">information page</a> within the Graasp Library highlighting the concept of Open Educational Resources (OER).

## Graasp Player

- **Display Folder Thumbnails on Shortcuts**: Display thumbnails of folders alongside shortcuts in the Graasp Player interface, allowing users to quickly identify specific folders based on visual cues.
- **Add Tooltips on Disabled Navigation Buttons**: Provide informative tooltips for disabled navigation buttons (chat and pin buttons) within the Graasp Player. We plan to provide more features to reader users, stay tuned!

## Apps

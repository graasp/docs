## Builder

- Adds automatic suffix to names to copied items.

## Library

- Updates default search to exclude content within collections. This setting, previously enabled by default, often led to confused results. It is now disabled by default but can be enabled by users seeking to explore more content.

## Player

- Resolves minor issues with lost query parameters during navigation.
- Updates translations in Spanish, Italian, and German.

## Apps

- Updated apps to utilize a transparent background, seamlessly blending with the new purple-ish backdrop.

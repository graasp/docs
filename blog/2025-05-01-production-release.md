## Maintenance notice

To keep you informed and avoid surprises, the app now displays a clear message delivering maintenance dates when the system will undergo updates or temporarily be unavailable. This ensures that you’re aware of any planned downtime or disruptions before they affect your workflow, helping you plan accordingly and stay in control. It’s a small but important step toward improving transparency and communication with our users.

## Interface (details)

- A message will now appear when the system is under maintenance.
- Bookmarks on the home page can be removed by clicking on the "Manage" button.
- You can now download items directly from the item menu.
- Some missing translations were added to make actions clearer.
- developer: The documentation (instructions for using the app) has been updated.

## Backend (details)

- A new feature was added so the system can report when it's in maintenance mode.
- Improved recovery during item reordering.
- Updates dependencies.

## Analytics

- **Implement RTL for Arabic language**: Ensure that the entire Analytics interface supports right-to-left text alignment for Arabic, providing a user-friendly experience for Arabic-speaking users.
- **Update French translations**

## Builder

- **Allow downloading an item as a raw file (instead of a zip)**: Users can now download individual files directly without having them compressed into a zip archive, enhancing accessibility and ease of use.
- **Implement RTL for Arabic language**: Adapt the Builder interface to support right-to-left text alignment for Arabic, ensuring a seamless user experience for Arabic-speaking users.
- **Show thumbnails on map view**: Display thumbnail previews of items directly on the map view, allowing users to quickly identify and select items visually.
- **Improve search**: Enhance the search functionality to include searching within content, descriptions, and names of items, making it easier for users to find specific items based on detailed criteria.
- **Optimize item layout rendering when selecting items**: Improve the performance of selecting items, ensuring a smoother and more responsive user experience.

## Backend

- **Publish only validated items**: Ensure that only items that have passed validation checks are published, maintaining the quality and integrity of the content available to users.
- Implement member password routes (POST and update PATCH)
